In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks.

## [Project 2: Science Researchs](https://github.com/HienThNg/Psychological_Capital)

### Topic: Impact of psychological capital on student's engagement and performance at universities in Ho Chi Minh City.

These are the components of my researchs at the university. I worked as a data analyst, responsible for gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
